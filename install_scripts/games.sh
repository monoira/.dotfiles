# NOTE: To ensure compatibility with 32-bit and 64-bit games in Steamâ€™s extensive library, enable 32-bit support.
# Lower-end systems, which often run 32-bit games, particularly benefit from this support.
# Meanwhile, high-powered systems experience no negative impact from installing additional packages.
# To enable 32-bit support on your Ubuntu system, run the following command:
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y upgrade

echo "<--- installing lutris... --->"
sudo apt install -y lutris
