## optional tips you might want to consider

- pause auto update / refresh of all snap packages

```bash
sudo snap refresh --hold
```

- use latest lts version of nodejs and npm via nvm

```bash
nvm install --lts && nvm use --lts
```

## Q&A why are you using both snap and flatpak?

I tried to only use flatpak, but had some problems with following packages

- steam

Installing via flatpak or apt steam-installer didn't worked, since
it kept giving me unmet dependencies error.
Building .deb package with "dpkg -i" means it won't update.
I WILL CHECK LATER. Until then, I have to use snap version.

I would love to only use flatpak and get away from snap,
But it is what it is.
I will re-check in the future if I can replace those packages
with non-snap versions and finally be snap-free.

- neovim

Neovim in apt is severely outdated, PPA version is outdated and
flatpak version is TERRIBLE, buggy and overly sandboxed.
Building .deb package with "dpkg -i" means it won't update.
